# Heathcare System FastAPI Project

## Overview

This project is a healthcare appointment scheduling system. It focuses on designing and implementing a robust, secure backend service that manages patients and enables them to schedule appointments with doctors.

The backend is built using Python FastAPI for the API framework, ORM-Alchemy for data modeling and database interactions, and MySQL as the database.
